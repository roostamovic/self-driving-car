  <h3>To run this code on your PC, you should first donwload a game which was developed by <a href="https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim">Udacity</a> to play and collect training data</h3>
  <h3>When you opened the game, to gain a training data you should choose <u><i>TRAINING MODE</i></u> and play. <u>DON'T FORGET!</u> You ought to drive 5 laps forward and turn around, then again drive 5 laps forward, otherwise your car may get in trouble when driving on its own. When you are driving, game itself saves all the photos in format <u><i>.jpg</i></u> in the folder <u><i>SimulationData</i></u> which will be your training data and one <u><i>.csv</i></u> file to read all the information in <u>Pandas</u>. After all you will open the game again and choose <u><i>AUTONOMOUS MODE</i></u> and enjoy the driving of your car without your interference</h3>
