**Self-Driving Car**
# To run this code on your computer, you should first donwload a game which was developed by Udacity to play and collect training data, here's the link: 
https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim
 *When you opened the game, to gain a training data you should choose 'TRAINING MODE' and play. DON'T FORGET! You ought to drive 5 laps forward and turn around, then again drive 5 laps forward, otherwise your car may get in trouble when driving on its own. When you are driving, game itself saves all the photos in format 'jpg' in the folder 'SimulationData' which will be your training data and one 'csv' file to read all the information in 'Pandas'. After all you will open the game again and choose 'AUTONOMOUS MODE' and enjoy the driving of your car without your interference*
